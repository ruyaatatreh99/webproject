    JERUSALEM</b></bre><br>
<pre style="color: white; font-family: 'Kristen ITC';padding-left: 10px">
    is perhaps the only city in the world that is considered historically and spiritually significant to Jews,Christians, and Muslims alike.
    The city of Jerusalem is known in Arabic as Al-Quds or Baitul-Maqdis("The Noble, Sacred Place"),and the importance of the city to Muslims comes
    as a surprise to some Christians and Jews.

    Jerusalem is considered to be the cultural, spiritual and national center of the Jewish people and the Jewish state, it is also a holy city to Islam and Christianity
    and is also one of the oldest cities in the world. The City of Gold, is a fascinatingly unique place where the first century rubs shoulders with the twenty-first century
    each jostling for legitimacy and space,
    and where picturesque "old" neighborhoods nestle against glistening office towers and high-rise apartments.
    It is one of those places which has to be seen to be believed.</pre>
<bre id="ddd" style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC' ; color: white"><h1   style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:darksalmon"><b>Districts</b></h1>
    Jerusalem is a large city and it can be divided up into districts:
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
        <li>The Old City and its Walls form a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This tiny ancient city is home to holy sites for Jews, Christians, and Muslims, and is truly breathtaking.</li>
        <li >West Jerusalem is the Israeli part of Jerusalem, also known as New Jerusalem; it is the modern commercial heart of the city, having become the focus for development in the city from the time of the creation of the Jaffa-Jerusalem Railway in 1892. To preserve the Old City, the Ottomans would not allow the train to reach its walls, so the Kahn station was located to the west.</li>
        <li >East Jerusalem is, roughly, the Eastern side of Jerusalem. East Jerusalem is made of territory taken by Israel from Jordan during the Six Day war of 1967. The territory was annexed when the war ended and Israeli law is imposed on it, unlike the West Bank which is considered by Israeli law to be under military rule. Israeli law also considers East Jerusalem to be part of Israel; these claims cause considerable controversy in the international community where they are unrecognized. The city is now home to approximately 200,000 Israeli settlers while most of Jerusalem's Muslim and Christian populations of approximately 250,000 have long lived here.</li>
        <li>Me'a Shearim is the area of Jerusalem inhabited largely by ultra-Orthodox Jewish people, a place where modest dress is required. The area looks like a 19th century Russian town with largely Yiddish speaking inhabitants.</li>
        <li>The German Colony is a West Jerusalem neighbourhood southeast of the city centre. It's a wonderful place to drink coffee and to eat in restaurants. You may hear more "Anglos" speaking English than Hebrew on these streets. It is located around Emek Refaim street.</li>
        <li>Ein Kerem is a (relatively) secluded neighbourhood in West Jerusalem that maintains a village atmosphere. It is surrounded by picturesque hills dotted with olive and cypress trees, home to artists and sculptors who have opened numerous galleries. Several churches are built on the site believed to be the birthplace of John the Baptist. Before 1948, the site was an Arab village called 'Ayn Karim .</li>

    <p id="mmm"style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:white"><H1 style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:darksalmon"> More about Jerusalem!</H1>Understand
    acting as a border city between Israel and Palestine(Bordering the Palestinian cities such as Abu Dis and Ramallah). Jerusalem is considered holy to the three major Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. it is also the cultural, historical and national center of the Jewish and palestinian people. Jerusalem is the third-holiest city in Islam and is also home to a number of significant and ancient Christian landmarks. It is also a city with a very violent past, as it has been severely damaged several times, from the  Roman wars, that ended with the burning of the city, to the 1967 Six Day War.  all religious, and socioeconomic groups are represented here. The walled area of Jerusalem, which until the late nineteenth century formed the entire city, is now called the Old City and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. It consists of four ethnic and religious sections — the Armenian, Christian,Muslim , and  Jewish . Barely one square kilometer, the Old City is home to several of Jerusalem's most important and contested religious sites including the Western Wall and Temple Mount for Jews, the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims, and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre for Christians.</p>
</bre>

<p style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:white">
    Surrounding the Old City are more modern areas of Jerusalem. The civic and cultural center of israel extends from western Jerusalem toward the country's other urban areas to the west, while areas populated by Arabs can be found in the northern, eastern and southern districts.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:white">Archaeological findings prove the existence of development within present-day Jerusalem as far back as the 4th millennium BCE, but the earliest written records of the city come in the Execration Texts (c. 19th century BCE) and the Amarna letters (c. 14th century BCE). According to Biblical accounts, the Jebusites, a Canaanite tribe, inhabited the area around the present-day city (under the name Jebus) until the late 11th century BCE. At that point (c. 1000s BCE), the Israelites, led by King David, invaded and conquered the city, expanding it southwards and establishing it as the capital of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah (the United Monarchy). It was renamed at this time as Yerushalayim (Jerusalem), a name by which it is still referred to today.</p>
<bre id="rrr" style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:white"><H1 style="font-family: 'Kristen ITC';color:darksalmon">Religion</H1>
    Jerusalem is considered home by large numbers of adherents to three of the four Middle Eastern monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Adherents of these faiths have tended historically to congregate in various neighborhoods of the city, with considerable overlap.</bre>
